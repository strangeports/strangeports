## Thank you for taking a second to look over this.

The initial idea of this repository is simply as a share so people can grab stuff to build their own thing. However that will likely change as individual projects mature.

One indication that it may be time to open the doors to contributors is if there's interest in contributing.
That being said, if you are interested in contributing, feel free to drop me a line and we'll kick the idea around and see what comes of it.

Thanks again and I hope you have a great day!
